## Milestones

Milestones concept is a \`key feature\` in \`Agile methodologies\`, which will divide the project into milestones (\`smaller releases\`), which makes it easier to maintain and launch the project quicker with better productivity.

Another great feature that there is a \`free to select\` option for members, as the \`Project manager\` / \`Team Leader\` can create tasks to be selected by any member, also tasks can be assigned directly to certain members.

## Project Privacy
Your project(s) can be visible to anyone visiting \`PMS\` page, or you could set it as a \`private\` project, this will make the project **invisible** to users, however, you can send invitation to members to join the team using their \`usernames\`.

There are many types of documentations for any project, we provide you the following to handle:
